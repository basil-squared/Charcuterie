# About

Charcuterie is a content mod of mostly random stuff and aims to be **Vanilla ++**, a little better than vanilla in some cases but mostly tries to stick to the formula. With plenty of features, cards, and soon-to-be blinds, you're sure to have a fun time with my little passion project.

## Content

Charcuterie comes with 
* 75 Jokers
* 8 Enhancements
* 2 New mechanics
* 1 New set of consumables
* 3 New Spectral Cards
* 2 New Tarot Cards
and so, so much more.

## Risk
Charcuterie introduces a mechanic called **Risk**, a value that is capable of influencing in-game negative decisions. For instance, if risk is 40%, then a card has a 60% chance of producing a negative effect, and however high risk is influences this.

## Overclocking
Ever wanted to get just a bit more juice out of some cards? Well, with overclocking, that can happen! All you have to do is fufill the dynamic condition the card wants, and one transformation later, the card is in its perfected form, allowing you to reach antes unseen by man.
## Dependancies
Charcuterie requires just a couple mods to get you going. you'll need
